title: University of North Carolina at Greensboro ePortfolio
subtitle: Hello, my name is Chadwick Dunefsky. Welcome to my ePortfolio.

This ePortfolio demonstrates how I have met each of University of North Carolina at Greensboro's (UNCG) program learning outcomes (PLO) for the Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS) program. These PLO's were met through various artifacts I created through my coursework while at UNCG. My ePortfolio features my artifacts, resume, a template cover letter, and my five year plan. Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, please send me an email using the email icon at the bottom of this website.
