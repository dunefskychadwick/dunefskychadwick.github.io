## Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to formally apply for the Digital Project Assistant position. The Digital Maryland project is a fantastic endeavor to promote the heritage of Maryland. Throughout my career, I have committed myself to embracing technology and understanding how it can be used to transform history and artifacts into a new medium. The Enoch Pratt Free Library’s commitment to promoting Maryland heritage through innovative and evolving technologies is why I would thrive as a Digital Project Assistant. I am interested in returning to my home-state and diving into the storied past of my childhood home.


At GlaxoSmithKline, I worked with a digital asset management system, Qi, and learned how to interact with pharmaceutical products and marketing materials through a digital system. I also worked with born-digital content in the form of COVID-19 material, and promoted the importance of preserving the company’s immediate response to COVID-19. At the D. H. Hill Jr. Library Special Collection, I had the pleasure of working with a new grant exploring the history of animal rights. My primary responsibility was to scan these sensitive materials and to create metadata for the library’s special collections website. I recall many discussions with my boss on best practices in scanning and understanding the tools needed to handle fragile material. Through my coursework, especially with “Information Organization and Access”, and “Digital Libraries”, I worked extensively with Dublin Core metadata and CONTENTdm. These projects can be found in my portfolio, linked at the bottom of this cover letter. I would be excited to learn more about how Enoch Pratt Free Library uses CONTENTdm and metadata to advocate for Maryland heritage.


I have a varied background in working both collaboratively and independently. At my jobs, I have collaborated with teammates both remotely and in-person. I have used a wide array of communication tools to ensure projects are completed on time.


I look forward to hearing from you and performing an interview. I would be excited to be a Digital Project Assistant for the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely yours,

Chadwick Dunefsky
