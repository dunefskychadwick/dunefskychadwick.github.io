| Complete my practicum with Duke University’s AUX Department | As of October 2021, I am halfway complete with my practicum.

**Year 2: 2022**

| Goals | Strategies | Resources |
| :----- |:------ | :- |
| Complete my internship with Wake County Public Libraries (WCPL) | I started my internship with WCPL in September 2021. My internship will end in May, 2022. In 2022, after feeling more confident and established in my internship, I plan on seeking more opportunities to expand my skillset for future public library jobs. I plan on asking my manager and WCPL librarians about programming and shadowing opportunities so I can learn more about the skillset a librarian needs to succeed. | WCPL |
| Present at the Society of North Carolina Archivists’ (SNCA) 2022 conference | In my Special Collections class at UNCG, I wrote a paper on the influence of power dynamics in organizational memory. I intend on presenting this paper at the SNCA 2022 conference. I will reach out to Dr. Post, my professor for this course, for guidance and support through the process. | SNCA, Dr. Post |
| Either continue working with WCPL as an official library assistant or locate my first Librarian 1 position at a public library. | In August 2022, I will talk to my manager about transitioning from an intern to a library assistant. If I am not offered this position, I will apply for Librarian 1 positions nationally. For the latter, I will seek advice and support from my manager at WCPL as I shift into a Librarian 1 position.  For this five-year plan, I will assume that I will be looking for Librarian 1 positions at this time. | WCPL, [https://inalj.com/](https://inalj.com) |
