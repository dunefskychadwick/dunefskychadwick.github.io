<h1 align="center"> Five Year Plan </h1>

-----------------------------------------------------

**5 Year Goal - Find a Librarian 2 Position**

I am writing this five year plan in October, 2021. At this time, I am in my last semester at UNCG’s MLIS program.

In December, 2021, I will graduate and will continue working as an intern at WCPL.

After I complete my internship, I will transition into a Librarian 1 role. In the next five years, I would like to apply my Librarian 1 role towards advocating for LGTBQIA+ issues, local history topics, and digital literacy.

At the end of these five years, I will transition to a Librarian 2 position and will continue working on these issues for the entirety of my career as a librarian.

The plans in place for this five year plan will provide a framework for my future career and will provide long-term collaborations and partnerships with both fellow library staff and with local communities and organizations.  

-----------------------------------------------------

**Steps to Complete My Five Year Plan**
1. Graduate from UNCG.
2. Complete my internship at WCPL.
3. Transition into a Librarian 1 role.
4. Create partnerships with the local community.
5. Bring local history and LBGTQIA+ issues into the public library that I will be working at.
6. Transition into a Librarian 2 role.
