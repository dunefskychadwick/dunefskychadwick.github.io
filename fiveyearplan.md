**Year 1: 2021**

| Goals | Strategies | Resources | Evidence of Completion |
| :------------- |:--- | :--- | :--- |
| Complete my practicum with Duke Universityâ€™s AUX Department| As of October 2021, I am halfway complete with my practicum. I will continue to seek support both from my practicum supervisor and Dr. Depolt to ensure that I create two artifacts by the end of the practicum. | Duke University Libraries, Dr. Depolt, Dr. Bird | Two artifacts |
| Attend the NCLA as a student | My manager at my internship with WCPL paid for my conference fee this year. I intend on attending the virtual conference on October 15th and network with fellow librarians. | NCLA, WCPL | Informational interviews scheduled |
| Graduate from UNCG with my MLIS | As of October 2021, I am halfway through my last semester. I will continue to seek support from my professors and classmates to ensure that I am able to complete my coursework and capstone by December, 2021. | Dr. Depolt, Dr. Bird | MLIS |

**Year 2: 2022**

| Goals | Strategies | Resources | Evidence of Completion |
| :------------- |:--- | :--- | :--- |
| Complete my internship with WCPL | My internship will conclude in May, 2022. I plan on seeking more opportunities to expand my skill set for future public library jobs. I will ask my manager and WCPL librarians about programming and shadowing opportunities. I will also look for opportunities to do informational interviews so I am better prepared to transition into a librarian role when my internship ends. | WCPL | Experience as a library assistant |
| Present at the SNCA 2022 conference | In my Special Collections class at UNCG, I wrote a paper on the influence of power dynamics in organizational memory. I intend on presenting this paper at the SNCA 2022 conference. I will reach out to Dr. Post, my professor for this course, for guidance and support through the process. | SNCA, Dr. Post | A presentation (a Powerpoint or a physical poster) |
| Either continue working with WCPL as an official library assistant or locate my first Librarian 1 position at a public library. | In August 2022, I will talk to my manager about transitioning from an intern to a library assistant. If I am not offered this position, I will apply for Librarian 1 positions nationally. For the latter, I will seek advice and support from my manager at WCPL as I shift into a Librarian 1 position.  For this five-year plan, I will assume that I will be looking for Librarian 1 positions at this time. | WCPL, [https://inalj.com/](https://inalj.com) |
