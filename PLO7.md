## 7.1 Oral communication : Effectively engage in oral communication in professional contexts.

For my field experience, I worked with the Assessment & User Experience department at Duke University Libraries. This reflection was created after a mid-semester interview with my field experience supervisor. Both the reflection and the interview used a SWOT Analysis Matrix to discuss my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats from the first half of my field experience.

The interview demonstrates that both through the field experience and the interview itself that I have demonstrated the ability to effectively engage in oral communication. The reflection serves as a written record of the SWOT analysis I covered in my interview.

A recording of the mid-semester interview has been submitted directly to the professor supervising my field experience.

## 7.3 Collaboration within a Library or Information Organization: Works with others within the organization to achieve meaningful outcomes.

This reflection was created after an exit interview with my field experience supervisor. We primarily discussed my strengths and weaknesses throughout the practicum. We used a SWOT Analysis Matrix and two questions from my practicum supervisor to structure this meeting. 

The interview demonstrates that I have successfully completed my practicum and that I have sufficiently collaborated within a library system, working with my practicum supervisor and other employees within my practicum department. I created two final artifacts with a fellow practicum student, featured on PLO 3, which satisifies the expectation of achieving meaningful outcomes.
