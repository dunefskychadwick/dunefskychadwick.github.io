## 7.1 Oral communication : Effectively engage in oral communication in professional contexts.

For my field experience, I worked with the Assessment & User Experience department at Duke University Libraries. This reflection was created after a mid-semester interview with my field experience supervisor. Both the reflection and the interview used a SWOT Analysis Matrix to discuss my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats from the first half of my field experience.

The interview demonstrates that both through the field experience and the interview itself that I have demonstrated the ability to effectively engage in oral communication. The reflection serves as a written record of the SWOT analysis I covered in my interview.

A recording of the mid-semester interview has been submitted directly to the professor supervising my field experience.

## 7.3 Collaboration within a Library or Information Organization: Works with others within the organization to achieve meaningful outcomes.

This artifact will be uploaded by the end of day on November 29th. I will fill in this PLO after I complete my exit-interview for my field experience. I intend on using the interview and reflection to talk about how I collaborated within Duke University's Libraries to achieve the two artifacts featured on PLO 3 and my field experience reflection.
