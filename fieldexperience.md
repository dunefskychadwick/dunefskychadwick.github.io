I conducted my field experience with the Assessment & User Experience (AUX) department at Duke University working with Emily Daly, the head of the AUX department. This field experience was completed in collaboration with a fellow Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) student. For how this practicum met my program learning outcomes, please click the "Program Learning Outcomes" tab at the top and click on "PLO 3" and "PLO 7."

In collaboration with the fellow student and Emily Daly, we created two products to be used by the AUX department. The first product we created was a usability test. A usability test, in the case of the AUX department, is an interview with students that demonstrates how students of different years interact with certain elements of a website. We conducted these usability tests over Zoom, relying on the screen sharing feature to see how students directly interacted with the AUX's updated staff directory page. The staff directory was updated to include two new search boxes that were intended on improving the user experience of finding relevant library staff information. With the fellow MLIS student, we created a final report detailing our findings and recommendations and provided this report to the AUX department to be used in future iterations of the staff directory. 

The second product we created was an environmental scan with a supplemental report. Duke University Libraries (DUL) currently has a point person for accessibility resources and they are in the process of probing ways that accessibility can be expanded at DUL. With the fellow MLIS student, we created a spreadsheet collecting information from eight universities and one public libary. The supplemental report relied on academic journals to support our recommendations and findings. These two documents will be provided to the accessibility resources point person and potentially be used in future expansions of accessibility resources at DUL.
