## 3.2: Gather and Evaluate Evidence: Gather and evaluation a variety of types of existing and/or new evidence.

During the first half of my field experience, I collaborated with a student at North Carolina Central University to create a usability test investigating the staff directory on the Duke University Libraries website. The staff directory was redesigned during my field experience, in October 2021. The redesigned staff directory included two new search boxes, for users to search either the current section of the directory or the full directory. Our usability test was designed to learn how Duke University students interacted with these new search boxes.

This test effectively demonstrates gathering and evaluating evidence, to create recommendations that will be used for future iterations of the staff directory.

## 3.4: Apply Evidence to Design Solutions: Identify, describe, propose, implement & assess - criteria for levels.

During the second half of my field experience, I collaborated with a student at North Carolina Central University to create an environmental scan and a supplemental report to investigate how universities in the United States implement accessibility resources on their library website. We also gathered evidence on how universities structure their disability or accessibility department (if one existed) within their library. The environmental scan is a spreadsheet featuring eight universities and one public library. The supplemental report backs up our investigation with research gathered from academic journals on accessibility within libraries. The environmental scan and supplemental report will be used by the accessibility point person at Duke University Libraries to further reflect on how Duke can implement these resources in their library system. 

This environmental scan effectively demonstrates an ability to identify and propose solutions and ways to implement them within Duke University.
