## 3.2: Gather and Evaluate Evidence: Gather and evaluation a variety of types of existing and/or new evidence.

During the first half of my field experience, I collaborated with a LIS student at North Carolina Central University to create a usability test investigating the staff directory on the Duke University Libraries website. The staff directory was redesigned during my field experience, in October 2021. The redesigned staff directory included two new search boxes, for users to search either the current section of the directory or the full directory. Our usability test was designed to learn how Duke University students interacted with these new search boxes.

This test effectively demonstrates gathering and evaluating evidence, to create recommendations that will be used for the next version of the staff directory.

Note: This usability test will be finished this week, after the submission of this rough draft. I will update the website when it is finished.

## 3.4: Apply Evidence to Design Solutions: Identify, describe, propose, implement & assess - criteria for levels.

I will be creating an environmental scan in my field experience after the usability test is officially finished this week. I will include how this environmental scan met this PLO once this is finished, before the final draft of this website is due.
