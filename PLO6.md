## 6.2 Engages in Strategic Planning: Engages in long term focusing of organizational efforts towards a common mission.

With a group of three students, we created a five year plan to recommend ways the Pack Memorialâ€™s North Carolina Room in Asheville, North Carolina can expand their collection to be more inclusive of Asheville's diverse population. My primary contribution to this five year plan is to consider the development of LGBTQIA+ studies in Appalachia and how these studies can shape the LGBTQIA+ collection at the North Carolina Room.

My contributions combined with my group create an effective strategic plan for the North Carolina Room to expand their collection. The Five Year Plan details current research growth, a detailed timeline, and high level activities to successfully complete this major collection overhaul.

## 6.4 Project Management: Leaders plan deliberate steps to execute, monitor, analyze, and report on the progress of a work group charged with the creation of a unique product, service or result in order to deliver the on-time/on-budget results, learning and integration that the project and its stakeholders require.

The artifact for this PLO will not be finished until November 3rd. I will update the portfolio then. I intend on using a group paper from LIS 650 (Leadership and Management in Information Organizations). This paper is a case report on analyzing a fictional work environment and creating recommendations to improve the toxic environment. The paper includes a memo detailing the issues, a case analysis report, and a reflection. Please let me know if this artifact will not work for this PLO.
