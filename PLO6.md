## 6.2 Engages in Strategic Planning: Engages in long term focusing of organizational efforts towards a common mission.

With a group of three students, we created a five year plan to recommend ways the Pack Memorialâ€™s North Carolina Room in Asheville, North Carolina can expand their collection to be more inclusive of Asheville's diverse population. My primary contribution to this five year plan is to consider the development of LGBTQIA+ studies in Appalachia and how these studies can shape the LGBTQIA+ collection at the North Carolina Room.

My contributions combined with my group create an effective strategic plan for the North Carolina Room to expand their collection. The Five Year Plan details current research growth, a detailed timeline, and high level activities to successfully complete this major collection overhaul.

## 6.4 Project Management: Leaders plan deliberate steps to execute, monitor, analyze, and report on the progress of a work group charged with the creation of a unique product, service or result in order to deliver the on-time/on-budget results, learning and integration that the project and its stakeholders require.

With a group of three students, we were provided a fictional story detailing Penny's complaints about various aspects of her job at her library. We created a page memo recommending ways that Penny can improve her work environment and improve her rapport with her coworkers. This page memo was supplemented with a case analysis report using academic literature to support our recommendations. 

This case report and case analysis report demonstrate our aiblity to execute, monitor, and analyze the different elements of Penny's worklife that are contributing to her frustrations. The group aspect satisfies the learning outcome's expectation of creating a unique product that recommends ways that Penny can detect results and integrate our case memo into her daily worklife.
