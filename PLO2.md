## 2.2 Assessment: Demonstrates the ability to engage in assessment of services, collections, products, user experience, and information technologies and articulates its importance in information provision.

I created a handbook on how libraries and archives can be used as heritage sites in North Carolina. This handbook details the importance of heritage tourism and how libraries and archives are central to talking about heritage. The handbook contains five examples, selected from the primary regions of North Carolina, to emphasize the fluidity of heritage tourism.

The handbook demonstrates information provision in discussing how libraries and archives can be used to connect individuals to both their individual past and to their community's past. The public library, as one example, serves as a free and central space in a community to talk about heritage. There is no expectation to exchange funds or to check out a book. Using five case studies, the handbook displays an assessment of services across different library institutions and how these case studies tie into information provision.

## 2.3 Design: Designs services, collections, products, and information technologies to respond to the needs of diverse communities with an emphasis on user-centered design.

LibGuides are an effective tool to educate students on how to learn about a new topic or tool. This LibGuide educates students on how to do public history in the triangle area (Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh) of North Carolina. The triangle area encompasses a rich history, connecting its residents to a breadth of history.

In Chapel Hill, the "Chapel Hill Nine" event reminds Chapel Hill citizens of its connection to the civil rights era. In Durham, the plantations bring forth vivid depictions of North Carolina's involvement in slavery. Raleigh's position as the state capitol allows students to understand how North Carolina politics created the state we live in today.

The LibGuide demonstrates a response to the needs of diverse communities by educating students on how they can do public history and to connect with the past. LibGuides as a tool for education align with this PLO's expectation on user-center design.
