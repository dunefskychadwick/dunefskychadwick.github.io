## 2.2 Assessment: Demonstrates the ability to engage in assessment of services, collections, products, user experience, and information technologies and articulates its importance in information provision.

I created a handbook on how libraries and archives can be used as heritage sites in North Carolina. This handbook details the importance of heritage tourism and how libraries and archives are central to talking about heritage. The handbook contains five examples, selected from the primary regions of North Carolina, to emphasize the fluidity of heritage tourism.

The handbook demonstrates information provision in discussing how libraries and archives can be used to connect individuals to both their individual past and to their community's past. The public library, as one example, serves as a free and central space in a community to talk about heritage. There is no expectation to exchange funds or to check out a book. Using five case studies, the handbook displays an assessment of services across different library institutions and how these case studies tie into information provision.

## 2.3 Design: Designs services, collections, products, and information technologies to respond to the needs of diverse communities with an emphasis on user-centered design.
