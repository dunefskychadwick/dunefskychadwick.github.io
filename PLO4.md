## 4.1 Identify instructional needs: Gather evidence, prioritizes needs and determines which problems can actually be addressed through instruction.

With a group of three UNCG students, we created a toolkit to recommend ways that a local artist, Stacey Kirby, could use her art in an educational context. Kirby's art encompasses a spectrum of political issues, typically in the form of performance art. Our toolkit demonstrated how her art could be used in varying subject areas within a school, including a drama or a civics course. Since Kirby's art is performative, individuals can only interact with her art if they visit the exhibit in person. Our toolkit demonstrates this PLO's goal in determining how we can bring performative art to education. The issues Kirby addresses in her art, including gender identity and voting issues, provide intricate and important lessons for any student.
