## 4.1 Identify instructional needs: Gather evidence, prioritizes needs and determines which problems can actually be addressed through instruction.

With a group of three UNCG students, we created a toolkit to recommend ways that a local artist, Stacey Kirby, could use her art in an educational context. Kirby's art encompasses a spectrum of political issues, typically in the form of performance art.

Our toolkit demonstrated how her art could be used in varying subject areas within a school, including a drama or a civics course. Since Kirby's art is performative, individuals can only interact with her art if they visit the exhibit in person.

Our toolkit demonstrates this learning outcome's goal in determining how we can bring performative art to education. The issues Kirby addresses in her art, including gender identity and voting issues, provide intricate and important lessons for any student.

## 4.2 Design Instruction: Engage in design thinking to plan lessons with reasonable instructional goals and all content/activities are aligned with instructional goals.

With a fellow UNCG student, we created a lesson plan on advocating for archives. Our lesson plan featured two artifacts, a written out lesson plan and a presentation. The presentation begins with a brief presentation on what advocacy means in the context of archives. Throughout this part of the presentation, we used discussion questions to engage with the class.

The second part of the presentation was a breakout session, with five case studies for each group to select from. We engaged in design thinking to ensure that this presentation effectively educated students in our class on advocacy.

Our lesson plan was carefully created so each part of our presentation included a form of engagement. We reflected on how each of our case studies for our breakout session would align with our goal on educating advocacy in archives.
