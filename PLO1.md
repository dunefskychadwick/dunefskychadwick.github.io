## 1.1 Knowledge Production: Articulates a basic understanding of human information needs and behaviors and describes how the many forms of diversity in our society impact information provision.
In this paper, I explored the relationship of power and memory-making within a company. I discussed how this relationship can negatively affect the development of a company’s archive.

This paper demonstrates how human behavior within a corporate setting changes in reaction to negative power dynamics. The result of this relationship directly shapes how individuals interact with the archive’s collection. The items within the collection may not exist because of this relationship, in fear of censorship or some form of punishment through fear or intimidation. Alternatively, the items might no longer reflect how they looked originally, as a result of censorship.

This paper is a preliminary discussion on this topic and suggests ways for future papers to further investigate how power dynamics impact information provision.

## 1.7 Professional Ethics: Articulates ethical perspectives on the organization and provision of information with an emphasis on promoting a just and equitable society.
In collaboration with three students, we created a libguide designed to recommend ways that the North Carolina Room in Asheville can expand their collection. My section of the libguide focused specifically on LGBTQIA+ individuals in Appalachia. The material within the libguide is a collection of LGBTQIA+ resources  tailored to the culture and history of Appalachia.

I created my section to recommend the North Carolina Room to expand their collection to reflect the local LGBTQIA+ community. The items featured in the libguide emphasize the resources in Appalachia that reflect the ongoing trend of increasing acceptance of LGBTQIA+ individuals. LGBTQIA+ individuals in Appalachia often face stigma and discrimination for their identity.

New language is constantly being developed and added to the American lexicon to affirm a diversity of identities. In Appalachia, LGBTQIA+ youth are adapting and adjusting to their local culture, to ensure they can create safe spaces to discuss LGBTQIA+ topics.

This libguide is intended to be part of a broader discussion in exploring the resources available within Appalachia to explore LGBTQIA+ identity.
