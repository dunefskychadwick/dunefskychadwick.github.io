## 5.3 Advocacy: Advocate for your organization and the Library and Information Science Professions.

I created this disaster plan for an imaginary repository in Raleigh, North Carolina. The disaster plan incorporates environmental concerns, unique to Raleigh to create recommendations for this repository. The disaster plan also includes a budget and a disaster response team designed to handle a wide variety of disasters. The facets of this disaster plan demonstrate advocacy for this fictional repository and an understanding of how the recommendations applied within this plan can be used for an actual archive.

## 5.5 Advocate for equity and access for your community, particularly for historically marginalized groups to overcome existing power structures.

This video recognizes the impact of Justine Hollingshead, the first director of the GLBT center on North Carolina State University (NCSU)'s campus. Hollingshead contributed to improving NCSU as a space for GLBT individuals. This video tells the story of how Hollingshead first came to NCSU and how she reacted to the initial hostility she found.

Prior to the creation of the GLBT center, NCSU always had a thriving GLBT community. The center affirmed their existence and cemented it as a part of NCSU's identity. I created this video to recognize the importance of creating centers on campuses for historically marginalized groups.
